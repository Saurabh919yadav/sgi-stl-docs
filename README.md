Standard template library (STL) documentation from SGI. This is a mirror of the content that used to be on SGIs site. They recently removed it. Thanks to [Martin](http://www.martinbroadhurst.com/sgi-stl-documentation.html) for backing it up for all of us.

This documentation discusses a lot of the design principles behind the STL, and rationale for why certain decisions were made. It also explains Alex Stepanov's [concepts](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/concepts) which he uses in the STL, but could not be expressed in the code (ForwardIterator, RegularType, etc). As far as I know, this information is not in any of the current documentation.
